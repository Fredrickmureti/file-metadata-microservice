Certainly! Here's a simple yet comprehensive README.md for your file upload project using MERN stack:

# File Upload App

This application allows users to upload files, storing file metadata in a MongoDB database, and retrieving uploaded file information.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js with Axios for API requests
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js, MongoDB with Mongoose for data storage, and Multer for handling file uploads

## Features

- **File Upload**: Users can select a file from their local machine and upload it to the server.
- **File Metadata Storage**: Metadata such as filename, size, MIME type, and path on the server are stored in MongoDB.
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling ensures smooth user experience and server reliability.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine
- MongoDB installed and running locally or accessible via a remote MongoDB instance

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd file-upload-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   # Install server dependencies
   cd server
   npm install

   # Install client dependencies
   cd ../client
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the server:

   ```bash
   # From the server directory
   cd server
   npm start
   ```

2. Start the client (in another terminal):

   ```bash
   # From the client directory
   cd client
   npm start
   ```

3. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## API Endpoints

- **POST /api/files/upload**: Upload a file. The frontend sends a `multipart/form-data` POST request to this endpoint with the file selected by the user.

## Folder Structure

- **client/**: Frontend React application.
- **server/**:
  - **models/**: MongoDB schema models (e.g., File model).
  - **routes/**: Express routes (e.g., file upload route).
  - **uploads/**: Directory where uploaded files are stored.
  - **server.js**: Main entry point for the server.
